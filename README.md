# sshttp

sshttp is a lightweight and efficient file transfer server that bridges the gap between SSH and HTTP protocols. It allows you to securely transfer files by accepting input via SSH and producing a URL that can be accessed to stream the contents of the SSH connection directly into the HTTP response.
